Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound

Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me in the warmth of your love when you depart
Keep me safe
Safe and sound

Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound

Drowning in an endless sea
Take some time and stay with me
Keep me in the strength of your arms
Keep me safe
Safe and sound

Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me safe
Safe and sound

Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me safe
We need light
We need love

Lift me up, in your arms (lift me up)
I need love, I need love, I need love (hold me down)
Hold me, hold me (keep me close)
Hold me, hold me (safe and sound)
Hold me, hold me

Hold me, hold me (lift me up)
Hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me (hold me down)
Keep me safe
We need light
We need love
